# OverwatchHeroes

'OverwatchHeroes.lua' contains the main code used for handling Overwatch Heroes abilities/cooldowns/melee with their animations.
There some other auxiliary scripts for this general functionality and many more script for each individual hero, but I didn't include them here, aside from the 'Genji.lua' which handles Genji's firing parameters and abilities.
